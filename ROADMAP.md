### Implementation Strategy

3. Add frontend permission guards using composable
4. Hide UI elements based on role

export function useProducts() {
  const { data, pending, error, refresh } = useFetch('/api/products', {
    query: {
      page: 1,
      limit: 20,
      category: undefined,
      search: undefined
    }
  })

  async function createProduct(product: ProductInput) {
    return await $fetch('/api/products', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: product
    })
  }

  async function updateProduct(id: number, data: Partial<ProductInput>) {
    return await $fetch(`/api/products/${id}`, {
      method: 'PATCH',
      body: data
    })
  }

  return {
    products: data,
    pending,
    error,
    refresh,
    createProduct,
    updateProduct
  }
}
```

## 📊 Database Considerations

### Indexes (Already in Schema)
- User: `role`, `isActive`, `lastSession`
- Product: `categoryId`, `brandId`
- Order: `userId`, `status`, `paymentMethod`
- SuperAdmin: `role`

### Migration Strategy
1. Schema is ready - run `pnpm prisma migrate dev`
2. Seed initial data (already seeding owner account)
3. Add seed script for demo products/categories

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
SUPERADMIN_OWNER_EMAIL="owner@example.com"
SUPERADMIN_OWNER_PASSWORD="secure_password"
SUPERADMIN_OWNER_NAME="Store Owner"
SESSION_SECRET="random_secret_key"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="..."  # For image uploads
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="..."
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="..."
```

### Production Optimization
- [ ] Enable Prisma connection pooling
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Set up image optimization service
- [ ] Configure CORS for API
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Configure logging
- [ ] Add API request validation with Zod
- [ ] Set up backup strategy

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Phase 1-2 Goals
- ✅ All product CRUD operations functional
- ✅ Orders visible and status updatable
- ✅ Customer data integrated

### Phase 3-4 Goals
- ✅ Dashboard shows real sales data
- ✅ Inventory tracking active
- ✅ Pricing rules applied correctly

### Final Goals
- ✅ All schema models have working APIs
- ✅ Role-based access fully enforced
- ✅ Dashboard is production-ready
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Performance optimized (< 3s page load)

---

## 🔄 Iteration Strategy

1. **Build API first** - Test with Postman/Thunder Client
2. **Create UI components** - Build reusable components
3. **Integrate & test** - Connect frontend to backend
4. **Refine UX** - Polish based on usage
5. **Document** - Add inline comments & API docs

---

## 📝 Next Immediate Steps

### Week 1 - Day 1-2
1. ✅ Create `/api/products/index.get.ts` with filters/pagination
2. ✅ Create `/api/products/index.post.ts` with Zod validation
3. ✅ Create `/api/categories/index.get.ts` with tree structure
4. ✅ Build `app/pages/products/index.vue` with UTable
5. ✅ Create product form component with image upload placeholder

### Week 1 - Day 3-5
1. ✅ Implement product update/delete APIs
2. ✅ Build product detail page
3. ✅ Add category selector component
4. ✅ Integrate image upload (use local storage initially)
5. ✅ Test full product CRUD workflow

### Parallel Planning - Brand Management

1. Draft brand CRUD endpoints (`GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/brands`) mirroring category validation and role checks.
2. Outline brand listing UI (table + create/edit modals) reusing shared form patterns from categories.
3. Update product editors and filters to consume a centralized brand lookup feed once the endpoints are live.

## 💡 Notes

- **Multi-language**: Use JSON fields for content (name, description)
- **Pricing**: Consider CartPricingRule application logic
- **Images**: Start with local storage, migrate to cloud later
- **Testing**: Add tests incrementally (Vitest + Playwright)
- **Documentation**: Keep this roadmap updated as you progress
